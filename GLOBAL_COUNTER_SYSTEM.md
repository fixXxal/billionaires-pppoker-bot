# 🌍 GLOBAL COUNTER SPIN SYSTEM

## ✅ How It Works:

### ONE Counter for ALL Users:
- **Global Counter** starts at 0
- Every user's spin adds +1 to the SAME counter
- Only the user who lands EXACTLY on a milestone wins!

---

## 🎰 Example:

```
Global Counter: 0

User A spins 5 times:
  Spin 1 → Counter: 1 (nothing)
  Spin 2 → Counter: 2 (nothing)
  Spin 3 → Counter: 3 (nothing)
  Spin 4 → Counter: 4 (nothing)
  Spin 5 → Counter: 5 (nothing)

## 💰 Your Cost Analysis:

### Scenario: 100 users, each deposits 5000 MVR (60 spins)
```
Total spins: 100 × 60 = 6,000 spins

Milestones hit:
- 10, 20, 30... (every 10) = 600 milestones
  But only 10, 20, 30, 40 pay 10 chips
  50, 100, 150, 200, 250, 300, 500, 1000 pay more

Let's calculate:
- Counter 10-40 (every 10): 4 × 10 = 40 chips
- Counter 50: 25 chips
- Counter 60-90 (every 10): 3 × 10 = 30 chips
- Counter 100: 50 chips
- Counter 110-140 (every 10): 3 × 10 = 30 chips
- Counter 150: 50 chips
... continues...

In 6,000 spins:
- 600 milestones at every 10 spins
- Some pay 10 chips (most common)
- Some pay 25, 50, 100, 250, 500 chips (rare)

Approximate total: ~8,000-10,000 chips for 6,000 spins
Cost: 8,000-10,000 MVR

Revenue: 100 users × 5,000 MVR = 500,000 MVR
Cost: ~9,000 MVR
Profit: ~491,000 MVR (98.2% profit!)
```

**But only ~120 users out of 100 actually win anything!**

Most users get 0 chips.
